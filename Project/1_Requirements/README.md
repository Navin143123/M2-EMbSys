## ABSTRACT

### The consumption of electrical energy is highly increasing now -a- days due to our day -to- day requirements. This will create a huge demand on electrical supply. This project describes the design and construction of fan speed control according to the room temperature. The temperature sensor was carefully chosen to gauge the room temperature.Depending upon the detection of temperature the system will work which is controlled by the Atmega328.

## IDENTIFYING FEATURES
###	* Atmega328 controller shall be used for the control of the system.
###	* LCD Display shall be provided to display temperature and Fan speed.
### * This system provides complete automation of rooms in home.
### * Considerable amount of electricity shall be saved.
### * Blind people shall get benefited.

## STATE OF ART
### This project can automatically switch ON room fan when at least one person presents in the room. The temperature and fan speed are displayed on 16*2 LCD through the Atemega328. This will save the electricity.
